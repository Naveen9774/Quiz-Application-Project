 Quiz Application 
I’ve developed a fun and interactive Quiz Application in Java! This console-based application tests your knowledge with 10 trivia questions and offers 3 lifelines (50-50, Audience Phone, and Skip Question) to assist players along the way. Players earn money for each correct answer, but one wrong answer ends the game. 
Key Features:
1️⃣ 10 multiple-choice questions.
2️⃣ 3 lifelines to aid in answering.
3️⃣ Scoring system with increasing prize amounts.
4️⃣ Simple and user-friendly console interface.
This project helped me strengthen my Java skills and implement features like user input handling, conditional statements, and lifeline mechanics.
